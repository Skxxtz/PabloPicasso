# PabloPicasso

This was a project I originally started with my brother. The main idea was to give the user the possibility to detect copyright infringements and take immediate legal action against it. Unfortunately, we never completely finished the website. Therefore, some graphics and functions are missing.

**Dashboard**
This site was the landing page for signed in users. The tiles are missing graphics for the specific actions.

**Account** 
This was the account overview. It has the functionalities for plan changes, password changes, and embeds a general summary of the users data.
Planned was also the function to delete the account.

**Picture Upload**
Here the user was able to upload/remove his/her images to the database and have an overview of how many pictures are currently uploaded.
